WEEK 7 STARTER (part 2 of 2) — serve the model over HTTP.

The model is a file on disk. This file is what turns it into something a care
management tool can call. Two endpoints, one model load, no surprises.

Fill in every section marked TODO. When you are done:

    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
    open http://localhost:8000/docs

Check your work:
    pytest tests/test_api.py -v

    Why here and not inside the endpoint: joblib.load() on every request would
    add hundreds of milliseconds and re-read the file each time. Load once,
    answer many.

    Fail loudly if MODEL_PATH does not exist: a service that starts up happily
    and then 500s on every request is worse than one that refuses to boot.

    TODO 3 — score one member.

    Steps:
      1. If the model somehow is not loaded, raise HTTPException(status_code=503).
      2. Turn `features` into a one-row DataFrame.
      3. Get the probability of the positive class.
      4. Compare against DECISION_THRESHOLD to get the bool.
      5. Return a PredictionResponse, rounding the probability to 4 places and
         echoing HIGH_COST_THRESHOLD_USD.

    Resist the urge to "fix up" the row on the way in — no rescaling, no unit
    conversion, no reordering columns. The pipeline you saved has its
    preprocessing inside it, and anything you do here happens on top of that.
    Errors of this kind are silent: no exception, just a different probability
    than the one your notebook reported for the same member. That is train/serve
    skew, and tests/test_api.py checks for it by comparing your endpoint against
    a direct model call across a spread of members.

    Also decide what a caller should get when the input is valid JSON but
    nonsense (pharmacy_claims greater than total_claims, say). FastAPI will not
    catch that for you.
