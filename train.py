WEEK 4 STARTER — train the baseline classifier.

Fill in the sections marked TODO. When you run this file, it should:
  1. Load data/member_summary.csv (generating it if missing)
  2. Split into training and test sets
  3. Fit a scikit-learn Pipeline that preprocesses features and trains a classifier
  4. Print evaluation metrics on the test set
  5. Save the trained pipeline to model.joblib

Run:
    python train.py

Check your work:
    pytest tests/test_leakage.py -v

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 0 — before you change anything.

The NUMERIC_FEATURES list below is every numeric column that comes out of
data/member_summary.csv, straight off the shelf. Get the TODOs working with
that list first, run the script, and write down two numbers:

    ROC-AUC:  ______        recall on the "High Cost" class: ______

Then ask yourself whether you would believe those numbers if a colleague
showed them to you in a review, and only then run the leakage tests.

    TODO 2 — Build and return a scikit-learn Pipeline with two steps.

    Step 1 — a ColumnTransformer named "preprocessor" that:
        - One-hot encodes CATEGORICAL_FEATURES.
          Use handle_unknown="ignore" so unseen categories at predict time
          don't crash the API.
        - Standard-scales NUMERIC_FEATURES.

    Step 2 — a classifier named "classifier".
        A RandomForestClassifier is a reasonable starting point.
        The dataset is imbalanced (positives are well under 15%), so think about
        how you want to handle that. Hint: see the `class_weight` parameter.
        Pass random_state=RANDOM_STATE so your results are reproducible.
